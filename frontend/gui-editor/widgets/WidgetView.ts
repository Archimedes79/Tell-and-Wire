 * `incoming` is what the end point it shows handed back last.

 * pane and the write pane both showed `value`, so typing a reply overwrote the
 * answer the user was reading, one character at a time. Widgets that only
 * display (`plot_window`, a read-only text_io) still just take
 * `incoming ?? value`; only the ones that do both need the distinction.
