/**
 * The page a graph shows: its blocks, in order, on one grid.
 *
 * **This module is the deployment boundary.** It holds what a *user* of the
 * finished tool sees and nothing else — no selection, no drag handle, no resize
 * corner. The designer's chrome lives in `DesignerSurface.tsx`, which imports
 * from here and which the runtime entry point cannot reach.
 *
 * That is a deliberate answer to a question with two tempting wrong answers.
 * Editing affordances behind an `editing` flag — what this was — still ship: a
 * flag that is false at runtime leaves dead code in the bundle, not absent
 * code, and the deployed tool was loading the palette, the grip and the
 * properties panel inside a 305 KB chunk it never used. A base class that the
 * runtime extends ships them for the same reason, because the subclass
 * references the base. Only the import graph decides what ends up in a bundle,
 * so the boundary has to be a module boundary — and `runtime/boundary.test.ts`
 * asserts that it stays one.
 *
 * It knows no graph and no store: whoever draws it hands it the page as
 * designed and what is in use -- the delivered tool from the runtime API, the
 * editor from its document and the same API -- and is told what was used.
