// Generating a whole graph, front to back.
//
// One ✨ button generates one element against whatever its neighbours happen to
// declare. That is fine for a node added to a working graph and useless for a
// graph that is empty: every node is generated against a guess, because the
// node it reads from has not been written yet.
//
// So the order matters, and it is the *execution* order — asked of the executor
// (`topologicalLevels`) rather than derived again here, so a graph is generated
// in the order it will run, including the memory-reads rule that keeps
// a loop through a data node from looking like a cycle.
//
// What travels forward is each node's output definition: a node is written
// whole -- its input.js, its output.js, its body -- before the next one is
// started, and the next one's input definition is written from what the node
// wired into it defines (`generationContext.inputSources`).
//
// Only nodes are written. A block on a page has no body: it shows or hands on
// what it holds.
