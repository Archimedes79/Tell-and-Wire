// ✨ for one node: what its buttons ask the backend, and what comes back, written in.
//
// A node's ✨ writes one of its files -- its input definition (input.js), its
// output definition (output.js), or its body: code.js, prompt.md, or what a
// data node holds -- through one route (`generate`), from one request built
// here: the node as the panel holds it, the graph around it in words
// ({Context}, `graphContext.ts`), what feeds each input and what each output
// feeds, and the files ✨ Input and ✨ Output are given. A node's panel,
// the toolbar's sweep and "what ✨ sends" all build it here, so none of them
// can tell the model less than the others. What comes back is written into the
// node by one pure function (`writtenInto`), and the exchange into its
// history.md.
