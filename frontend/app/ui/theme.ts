/**
 * The editor's colour vocabulary, and the few style objects built from it.
 *
 * One place, so the chrome stays in step and "make the panels a shade
 * lighter" is answered here, not in a hundred literals across the editor.
 *
 * Named by role, not by appearance, so the names stay true if the palette
 * changes. Rare one-off colours (a specific node type's tint, a chart accent)
 * deliberately stay where they are used -- this file is for the chrome that
 * repeats.
 */

/**
 * Every colour is a `var()` into the active scheme (ui/scheme.ts),
 * set once on the app shell. The literal after the comma is the default scheme,
 * so anything rendered outside the shell still has a colour rather than none.
 *
 * That indirection is the whole mechanism: a component asks for SURFACE exactly
 * as it did when these were literals, and switching scheme repaints the editor
 * and the designed page together without one call site changing.
 *
 * CSS variables resolve in style *properties* only, never in SVG presentation
 * attributes -- an SVG shape must take these through `style`, not `fill=`.
