/**
 * Every setting's one default: what a run reads a key as when a graph
 * leaves it out.
 *
 * So it is three things at once. What a node read from a file is filled with
 * where the file says nothing (`normalizeGraphNode`); what a save leaves out,
 * key by key, because it says nothing a run would not assume
 * (`savedNode`); and what every `NODE_KINDS[type].create()` starts from, so a
 * panel can read any field with a type. A new node that starts differently
 * -- a code node per item, an ai node with a system prompt -- says so in
 * `create`, and that is what its file then carries.
 *
 * One default per key: a second one, for what a *loaded* node lacks, is what
 * turned a graph written by hand into a different graph after one Save.
 * `savedConfig.test.ts` and `graphStore.test.ts` hold these to graph/.
