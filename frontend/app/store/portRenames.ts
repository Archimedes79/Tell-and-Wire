// Which port became which, across an edit of a node's ports.
//
// A port's id is the name a body reads it by -- `inputs.csv`, `{ figure }` --
// so it is the field the ports editor edits, and it is also what a wire points
// at. When the node panel writes a change, `updateNode` has to be told which
// id each port had before, or a renamed port loses its wires to the pruning.
//
// That used to be worked out by position: row 2 before is row 2 now. It is
// true of a rename and false of a removal. Remove the first of `prompt` and
// `context` and `context` slides into row 1, so it read as "prompt was renamed
// to context" and the removed port's wire moved onto `context`, which then had
// two -- the ✕ that promises "remove this port, and any wire on it" handed the
// wire to its neighbour instead.
//
// So each port carries the id it has in the graph (`trackPorts`, which the
// panel puts on the node as stored), and a port is followed by that, not by
// where it stands. It is kept under a symbol: an edit
// that spreads a port (`{ ...port, id }`, which is how the ports editor renames
// one) carries it along, and JSON never sees it, so the draft still compares
// equal to the stored node and nothing of it is ever saved.
