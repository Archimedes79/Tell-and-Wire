// The application ▶ Run starts, as an IDE runs the program it builds.
//
// One button, and it runs the tool the way whoever gets it will: with a page,
// the page opens -- its fields filled in as they are set -- and the graph runs
// when the page is used, a button pressed, a file picked. With a start point a
// call starts, the App tab opens as its caller, as a script would call it.
// Without either, what starts the graph starts it: a start point set to start
// when the tool starts starts, a clock keeps its time, and a graph with
// nothing that starts itself runs whole, once, as a program runs when it is
// started (`startEvents`). ■ Stop ends it.
//
// It runs until it is stopped where something is left to happen -- a page to
// use, a call to make, a clock to tick -- and ends by itself where nothing is:
// a graph that only computes, like a program that has returned.
//
// The clock is the server's, as a served tool's is (`host/session.ts`): the
// document is handed to the server's session, which keeps the time of its
// start points from ▶ Run to ■ Stop, so a round comes due in the editor when
// it would in a bundle, and asks nobody anything. It is the document that
// runs: while the application runs, what is edited is handed over a moment
// after, and the next round runs that. And it ends with the editor: closed or
// reloaded while it runs, the page tells the server to stop the clock, which
// would otherwise tick on with nobody there.
