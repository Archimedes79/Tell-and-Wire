 * Build time and run time in a builder: the bars of
 * `backend/app/times.test.ts`, mirrored.
 *
 * A builder is one class per kind, and its name now says what the bars below
 * once had to: `GuiBuilder` is build time, all of it. That was not always so --
 * it used to also carry what a deployed tool draws with (`View`, a few flags),
 * and the second kind travels into a tool with the class whether it is used
 * there or not. So the base classes still say which is which under three bars,
 * and this file checks that the run-time side of them has stayed empty.
