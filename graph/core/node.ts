 * here is the whole list, and it only ever allows -- there is no flag for "all
 * but". So the list is made: a body reads the working directory, where a
 * graph's files are, less the settings file that holds the keys (`aiSetting`'s
 * file, every one `secretPaths` names), and its own folder, the one `run`
 * makes for it; it writes its own folder only. A file elsewhere reaches it as an input typed `file_path`,
 * which the executor reads for it (`readsFileInputs`), and what it makes
 * leaves as an output, which an end point writes.
 *
 * What closes: starting other programs, loading native addons, spawning
 * worker threads, opening a debugger port. A body has no business doing any
 * of those, and a generated one is run by the sweep before anybody has read
 * it.
 *
 * What this does **not** close is the network: Node has no flag for it (Deno
 * does). A body can still reach out. Nor a link in the working directory that
 * points at the settings file: Node follows links past its own list.
