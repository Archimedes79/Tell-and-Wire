// Running a node once per item instead of once for the list.
//
// Three rules, and every one of them was found by running the same graph
// through this engine and the older one and diffing:
//
// **The size comes from the ports, not from the values.** A node fans out over
// its *declared-multi* inputs; a list arriving on a single-valued port is one
// value that happens to be a list. Guessing from the shape instead means a node
// that takes a list as one argument silently runs once per element of it.
//
// **An empty list is zero runs, not one.** A folder with no files should
// produce no results, and a body that has never seen an empty batch should
// never be asked to handle one.
//
// **No list, no fan-out.** Where no list arrived on an input declared one,
// the node runs once on everything, and its outputs that are not declared
// lists stay as that call returned them: per-item and whole-list agree
// wherever there was nothing to fan out. Where one did, every output is the
// list of what the items gave -- for one item, and for none -- so what a node
// hands on does not change shape with how many there were.
