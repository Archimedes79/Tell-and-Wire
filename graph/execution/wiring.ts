// Whether a graph's wiring holds together: every node its own id, every edge
// between two nodes that exist, on ports those nodes have.
//
// Asked by two readers, and they want different amounts. `check` lists all of
// it, a mistyped port included -- the ports are what a person reads to see what
// a node takes, and one that is not there is wrong however well the run goes.
//
// A run refuses to start on `fatalProblems` only, which is the shorter list on
// purpose. Values travel along edges and are keyed by the edge's port, not by
// what a node declared, so a graph written by hand with no ports declared runs
// correctly and must keep running. What is fatal is an edge to a node that is
// not there, which can only ever deliver nothing, and two nodes sharing an id.
