// The prompts a node is written with, and the one an ai node runs with: the
// standard texts, and the variables they name.
//
// A node says what should happen in its heading and its text; everything else
// is generated. Each chat -- the node's input definition, its output definition,
// its body -- is sent a prompt that puts the text together with what the node
// and the graph already hold, through variables (`VARIABLES` says what each
// is filled with).
//
// **Every standard prompt names the same four** (`SENT_WITH`): the node's text,
// its input, its output and the graph around it. That is what each chat tells
// a person it sends, so a node of any kind is written from the same facts.
// After the prompt the backend adds what the person said to the chat and its
// own frame, which is not the person's to edit: the file format and how to
// answer (`backend/graph-editor/generate.ts`).
//
// **Variables are filled by their exact names**, and nothing else in braces is
// touched: a prompt that holds JSON reaches the model as it was written. A
// variable nothing fills stays as written too -- an ai node's prompt.md is
// filled at run time with the two that mean something then.
