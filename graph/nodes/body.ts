// One way to run a body.
//
// A body is JavaScript somebody wrote, or a model did: a code node's `code.js`.
// It runs one way, and the probe that tries generated code runs it the same way:
//
//   async function run(inputs, node) { …; return { <output port>: value }; }
//
// - `inputs` is what arrived, keyed by port.
// - `node` holds `node.llm(...)`, a question put to the process that holds
//   the graph. Every body may ask, and its process is handed no key: the
//   environment it starts with has none (`core/node.ts`). What it can read on
//   disk it can read -- ai-settings.json included.
// - It runs in a process of its own (`core/node.ts`: no child processes, no
//   addons, no workers), and what it returns is the element's output.
//
// The element decides *when* its body runs and what happens to a failure; this
// is the only place that decides *how*.
