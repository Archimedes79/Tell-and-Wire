// What an element does when it runs.
//
// One class per node type and per widget kind, holding everything that kind
// needs to behave: what it stores, which ports it contributes, and what it
// does when the graph runs. Two branches share this base -- `NodeRunner` for a
// node, `WidgetRunner` for a block on a page -- and what they share is little:
// settings of their own, and whether a failure is caught. The rest is each
// branch's: a node has a body someone writes and files of its own, a block
// shows or hands on what it holds and writes nothing.
//
// **Why `Runner` and not `Element`.** An element has two halves, and the names
// say which is which rather than leaving it to the folder. This is the half the
// application is *made of*: it lives in the engine, it runs the graph, and it
// would still do so with no browser anywhere. Its counterpart is
// `frontend/app/elements/ElementGuiBuilder.ts` -- the half that exists only so a
// person can build the thing. Each concrete class is named the same way:
// `AiNodeRunner` beside `AiNodeGuiBuilder`, `SelectWidgetRunner` beside
// `SelectWidgetGuiBuilder`. `frontend/app/elements/symmetry.test.ts` holds the
// two lists to each other, class for class.
//
// **The element owns its config.** `config(subject)` reads the stored record
// and returns this element's own settings, with defaults applied. Nothing else
// reads another element's fields.
//
// **Services arrive as a `Runtime`** (`Runtime.ts`), never as an import.
//
// **Its browser half is a mirror, not a subclass.** How an element looks and
// is edited lives in the folder of the same name in `frontend/` (nodes/<kind>/ in graph-editor, widgets/<kind>/ in gui-editor)
// (`<Kind>View.tsx`, `<Kind>Panel.tsx`, `<Kind>GuiBuilder.ts`); nothing here
// imports it, which is what keeps the editor out of a deployed bundle.
