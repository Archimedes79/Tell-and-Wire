/**
 * What is happening while a ✨ button is busy.
 *
 * Generation used to be a minute of a spinning button and nothing else: what
 * was asked, what context went with it, whether the model had answered once
 * already and was being asked to repair its own code — all invisible until it
 * finished, and then only through a collapsed transcript nobody opens unless
 * something has already gone wrong.
 *
 * So this stands in the body's place while the body is being written, and is
 * gone the moment the result arrives. It is deliberately the *sent* text: a
 * bad answer is usually a bad question, and the question is the thing you
 * cannot otherwise see.
