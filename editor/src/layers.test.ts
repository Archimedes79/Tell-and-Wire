/**
 * The editor's layers, asserted on the import graph.
 *
 * An area may import from a lower one, never from a higher one, and never from
 * a sibling of its own rank. What each rank is:
 *
 *   0 ui         look, without knowing a graph: theme, tone, colour scheme, Modal
 *   1 graph      the document's types
 *   2 document   what a graph *is* to the editor: node kinds, the page's connections, grid placement
 *     api        the contract's client, and the session a page follows
 *   3 store      the open graph, its undo, what a round shows on it
 *   4 dialogs    small dialogs that ask the server something
 *   5 elements   the builders, their panels and their views
 *     authoring  writing a body: the editors a panel is made of
 *   6 page       a page, drawn and designed
 *     canvas     the graph, drawn
 *   7 app        toolbar, sidebar, results
 *   8 App, runtime   the two things that are served
 *   9 main       the entry
 *
 * `elements` and `authoring` are one tier and reach each other on purpose: a panel
 * is made of authoring editors, and an authoring editor asks the registry what a
 * node is. A panel is a lazy chunk, so the static graph has no cycle in it
 * (`runtime/boundary.test.ts` holds that a tool never loads either).
 *
 * `runtime` ranks with `App` -- both are served -- but reaches far less: nothing
 * in store/, canvas/, authoring/ or app/, however indirectly, as a delivered
 * tool holds no graph. That is a rule on what is reached, not on one import,
 * so `runtime/boundary.test.ts` holds it, walking the imports from runtime/.
