/**
 * Prose. The role -- heading, body, caption -- comes from the palette entry you
 * picked and is not offered again here.
 *
 * A heading and a paragraph were two widget kinds for a moment; they hold the
 * same string, contribute the same ports (none) and are typed into the same
 * box. What differs is formatting, so it is a `mode`, the same field
 * `input_picker` and `text_io` already use for their own variants. That made
 * a "role" dropdown possible, and possible is not the same as sensible:
 * offering to turn a heading into body text is offering to undo the choice
 * that put it on the page, one panel away from the palette that makes it
 * properly.
 *
 * There is no text box here either, any more. The words are typed on the page,
 * where they stand (`TextInPlace`); a second box holding the same sentence, in a
 * panel beside it, was two places to edit one thing.
