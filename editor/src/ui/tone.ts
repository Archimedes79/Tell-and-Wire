// How a block sits on the page, chosen from a closed set rather than picked

// A colour picker is how interfaces get ugly: every value is available, most
// combinations are wrong, and the person choosing is not a designer. Four roles
// drawn from the one palette cannot be combined badly — the same reason LaTeX
// gives you `\section` and not a font size.
//
// Named by role, not by appearance, so the names stay true when the palette
// changes (see ui/theme.ts, which is built on the same rule).

 * like an inspector. Every widget used to get the same border and background
 * unconditionally, plus a truncated dump of its own output underneath.
 *
 * The tone is the default; a `Look` overrides one thing at a time. A frame on
 * a plain block, or no frame on a raised one, is a choice about that block and
 * changes nothing else -- and a colour picked by hand is exactly that, the
 * person's own, not a fifth tone.
