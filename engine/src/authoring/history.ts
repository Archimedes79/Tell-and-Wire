// Every exchange -- each ✨ (input, output, body), each change asked for and
// each fix -- is appended as it happened: a heading with the date, the time and
// which it was, then, for every model call it made, what was sent and what came
// back. Oldest first, newest last, and beyond `HISTORY_LIMIT` the oldest are
// dropped whole, so a node written a hundred times does not carry a book.
//
// The engine owns the format; the editor appends after each exchange, and the
// file is the node's like its code: read, diffed and opened as what it is.
