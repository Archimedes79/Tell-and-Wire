//
// The file exists because a key is not something to type into a terminal on

//
// It is **not** in the repository and must not be: `.gitignore` names it, and
// `ai-settings.example.json` beside it shows the shape with no key in it.
//
// The same file says which tool servers this machine has (`mcp_servers`), and
// for those it is the *only* source -- see `configuredMcpServers` for why.
//
// And it holds the one AI setting, which `aiSetting` alone resolves.
