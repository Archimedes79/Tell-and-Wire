// Most providers speak the OpenAI chat-completions shape, so they are a table
// rather than five copies of the same twenty lines: where to POST, which
// credential to send, and whether that credential is mandatory. A sixth such
// provider is one entry — and a fix to the request shape cannot be applied to
// three of them and forgotten on the fourth.
//
// Ollama and Anthropic are deliberately not in that table: different endpoints,
// different payload keys, different framing. Pretending otherwise would cost
// more in special cases than the duplication saves.
//
// Each of the three is a `Conversation`: a history, a way to ask the model over
// it, and a way to write down what its tool calls came back with. A request
// with no tools is that conversation asked once. A request with tools is the
// same conversation asked until the model stops calling things -- so the loop
// is written once, below, and what differs per dialect is only what differs on
// the wire.

/**
 * The provider set, with one retry pass.

 * Retrying is not politeness: a local model under load answers with an empty
 * body often enough that a graph of fifty AI nodes will hit it, and the failure
 * it produces — an empty string flowing downstream — is invisible. One pass
 * costs a few seconds and removes the most common way a long run comes back
 * subtly wrong.
 *
 * The pass is around each *model call*, not around the request: with tools, a
 * request is several calls with side effects in between, and retrying the whole
 * of it because turn five came back empty would send the email twice.
