// The clock of a tool that runs by itself: what its start points start by themselves, one
// round after another.
//
// Kept by the server's session (`host/session.ts`) -- for the tool it serves,
// and for the application the editor's ▶ Run starts -- so there is one clock,
// and it goes on whether or not a page is open: a second one, in the browser,
// would come to disagree with it about when a round is due.
//
// What starting runs is `startEvents`'s to say: each start point set to start
// at start fires first. Each one with an interval then keeps its own time,
// counted from the end of its last round to the start of the next -- the rule
// `--every` follows on the command line -- so a round slower than its interval
// is followed by the next rather than overtaken by it. Rounds share one queue
// and never overlap.
//
// A start point is looked up again each time it is due, in the graph as it is
// then: deleted since, its clock stops rather than start a round for a node
// that is not there; its interval changed, the new one counts from then on.
