// What every node last produced, held until it runs again.
//
// A node's ◆ is a gate, and a round that does not open it leaves the node
// standing. But another node may run in that round and need what the first one
// made: the length of a summary is changed, the summarizer runs, and the reader
// whose ◆ hangs on the "Read" button does not. So an output is a level, not a
// moment -- it stays on the wire until its node runs again -- and this is where
// it stays.
//
// **Not the reuse cache.** `reuse.ts` is an optimisation: same node, same
// inputs, same answer, so the work is skipped -- and throwing it away changes
// nothing but the time a run takes. This is meaning: the last value *stands*,
// whatever the inputs are today, and a graph behaves differently without it.
//
// **Not a data node either.** That is memory somebody placed: it is in the
// graph, it is saved, it may close a loop. This is every output, by itself,
// for as long as the session using the graph keeps it -- in its state.json,
// across a restart -- and gone with a reset: then a gated node has nothing to
// hand on, and what needs it waits for the event that opens the gate.
//
// **Whose value it is.** A graph carries no identity of its own -- a new one
// is "Untitled Graph", like every other -- so a held value is kept under what
// made it: the graph's name and shape (its nodes and wires), the node as
// written, and every node upstream of it as written. Two graphs that differ
// anywhere a value could come from never hand each other one; edit a node's
// code, or the code of what feeds it, and what the old code made is not what
// the new one holds. A node that keeps something of its own -- a data node, a
// start point -- counts without its settings: they change with every round
// that settles into it, so "as written" would forget it each time.
