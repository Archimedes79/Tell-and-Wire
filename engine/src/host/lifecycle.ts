// What a served tool holds while it runs, and how it lets go of it.
//
// A server has a clock that starts rounds, runs a page started, children those
// runs spawned, and a socket. Each could always be stopped; nothing ever did.
// Ctrl+C, a closed terminal and `docker stop` all ended the process where it
// stood: a model call still billed and never read, a scheduled round cut off
// while writing the file it remembers itself in, and -- as PID 1 in a
// container, which gets no default signal handling -- ten seconds of ignoring
// SIGTERM before being killed.
//
// So the things that must be stopped are written down in one list, by whoever
// starts them, and stopped in the order they were started: what *makes* work
// before what carries it. A clock goes before the runs, the runs before the
// server that still has to answer "cancelled" to the page watching them.
//
// Deliberately small. It owns no resources and knows none of them; it is the
// order, the patience and the promise that stopping happens once.
