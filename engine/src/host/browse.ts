// Walking the machine's files, for a picker.
//
// Not editor-only, and that is the point: a deployed tool's picker shows
// folders, the parent and the drives too, so whoever was handed the tool is
// not held to one directory.
//
// The route is loopback-only in both cases (see `serve.ts`): it is the person
// at the keyboard browsing their own machine, who can open a file manager
// beside the tool and do the same thing. Listing a parent directory reveals
// nothing to anyone the file picker was not already for.
//
// What stays behind in `editor/files.ts` is what a recipient has no business
// with: looking for project folders, handing a node's file to an editor.

 * will run on. Hidden entries are left out; an unreadable child is skipped
 * rather than failing the page, since one denied entry should not make a
 * directory unbrowsable.
 *
 * @param path where to look; empty means *home*.
 * @param home where an empty path starts. The editor passes the folder it was
 *   started in, a deployed tool the folder its graph sits in — in both cases
 *   the root of the thing being used, rather than a home directory full of
