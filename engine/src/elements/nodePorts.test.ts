/**
 * Derived ports, checked against graphs people actually built.
 *
 * Only some nodes derive their ports: a start point, a folder node from its
 * settings, a subgraph from the graph it holds. For those a declaration nobody
 * checks is a second copy waiting to drift -- a node that emits `files` while
 * its stored ports say `output`.
 *
 * The others are skipped, and writing this test is what showed why. A code
 * node's input is called `file` and an end point's `einzeln`, because the
 * person who wired them named them to match their code and their prompt. An
 * element declaring `input` and `value` for those would be inventing a contract
 * nobody agreed to — so it declares nothing, and the graph is the authority.
 *
 * Both directions matter for the derived ones: a missing declaration breaks the
 * editor, an extra one draws a handle nothing will ever fill.
