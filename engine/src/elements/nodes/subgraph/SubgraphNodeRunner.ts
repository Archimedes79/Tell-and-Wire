/**
 * A node that holds a graph.
 *
 * **A subgraph is an ordinary graph**, and almost nothing here exists to make
 * that true -- the same `executeGraph` runs it, the same project folder stores
 * it, the same `check` checks it, the same editor edits it. What is left for
 * this file is one node's own contract: the dictionary at the boundary
 * (`boundary.ts`), what may stand at it (`problems`), and handing the values
 * across (`execute`).
 *
 * Three consequences worth stating, because all three are asked about:
 *
 * - A start point inside whose port nothing is wired to is not started from
 *   above: the graph inside runs, and it hands on what its design says it
 *   was sent -- what it is sent when it is run on its own.
 * - The graph inside can be run, checked and deployed on its own -- its folder
 *   is a project folder like any other. A subgraph that only works while
 *   enclosed would be a second kind of graph, and there is only one kind.
 * - Anything short of a clean run in there fails this node. From out here it
 *   is one node, and half of it having worked is not something a port can
 *   carry; `execute` says why at more length.
