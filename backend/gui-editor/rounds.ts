// The rounds of one session: one at a time, watched while they go, stopped when asked.
//
// Two runs at once would both read the graph as it was, both settle what they
// remember, and leave the page whichever finished last -- and with outputs that
// stand between rounds (`latch.ts`), a round would read what another is
// halfway through replacing. So the rounds of a session queue, in the order they were
// asked for, whoever asked: the page, the clock, a script.
//
// A round is started, reports as it goes, and is watched -- told to whoever
// listens, or looked at by polling; Stop aborts it. That is a small state machine with one owner, so it is one class:
// the session hands it the work and asks it for snapshots, and nothing outside
// knows what a round's record holds.
//
// A round that is waiting can still be stopped, and then it ends at once
// rather than when the one ahead of it does. A shutdown counts on that: it
// stops the clock's round queued behind a page's before it stops the page's.
