// of the table -- the graph it ships, a way to run it, the file picker its own
// blocks need. The editor gets its page and every row, the `editor` ones
// loaded from `graph-editor/routes.ts` only when this is the editor, so none of
// that code is ever vendored into a bundle.
//
// The table is the security boundary, and it is written out in one place
// (`api.ts`) rather than assembled from a router someone might extend later
// without noticing where it ends up. A route this server has no handler for is
// a server that cannot start: the page and the server never disagree about
// what exists.
