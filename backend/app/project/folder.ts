// A graph as a folder: the project.
//
//     my_tool/
//       flow.json           the flow: which nodes there are, and every wire
//       layout.json         where each node sits on the canvas, and its size
//       page/               the page: what whoever uses the tool sees
//         page.json         its blocks, in order, each with what it connects to
//       nodes/
//         count/            one folder per node, by id
//           node.json       its name and its settings
//           interface.json  what goes in and what comes out
//           input.js …      what the element keeps in files: `NodeRunner.texts`
//
// **Each fact in one place.** The flow says which node feeds which, and nothing
// about any node. A node's folder says everything about that node, and nothing
// about its neighbours: a node that needs to know what arrives follows the wire
// and reads the other node's `interface.json`. Positions are split off so that
// moving a node is not a change to what the graph does; writing -- code,
// prompts, the page's blocks -- is a file of its own so it is edited, reviewed
// and grepped as what it is.
//
// **The page sits beside the nodes, not among them.** It is no node: a graph
// has one page, what a person using the tool sees, and its blocks connect
// themselves to the graph's start and end points by name -- so its folder is
// the one anybody opening the project looks for, and flow.json does not name it.
//
// **One other shape opens.** A single `.json` graph with everything inline --
// what a download and an import carry -- opens as it is. A deploy bundle is a
// project folder like this one.
// Wherever a text has a file, the file wins over the inline value.
//
// **Everything reads through here.** The editor, a command line run, a served
// tool and the MCP server open a project the same way, which is the point: a
// node's code in `code.js` is the node's code wherever the graph is run from.
