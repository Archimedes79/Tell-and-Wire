// AI-Graph, offered to an assistant outside it.
//
// A Model Context Protocol server over stdio: Claude Code, Claude Desktop or any
// other MCP client can have a graph designed, check one, save it and run it.
// `ai/mcp.ts` is the other direction -- a graph's model calling out to somebody's
// tools. This is somebody's model calling in.
//
// **One file, one door.** Everything the outside can reach is the nine tools
// below, and everything they can reach is one folder. Three layers, so each can
// be read and tested without the others:
//
//   createGraphTools   what the tools do. No transport, no process, no globals:
//                      a test hands it a temp folder and a fake model.
//   serveStdio         JSON-RPC over two streams. Knows nothing about graphs.
//   runMcpServer       the real machine wired into the two above; `cli.ts`
//                      calls it for `--mcp`, and nothing else does.
//
// No SDK, for the reason the client has none: the engine has no runtime
// dependencies. It lives under `host/editor/` because it is authoring, and
// authoring is what a bundle does not carry -- `bundle.ts` skips every `editor/`
// folder, which is why `cli.ts` reaches this file with a dynamic import.
//
// THE CONFINEMENT RULES. The caller is a model acting on text it read somewhere,
// so every argument is treated as written by a stranger. Each rule has a test.
//
//   1. Every path argument is resolved against the root and must stay inside
//      it -- `..`, an absolute path elsewhere and another drive are all the same
//      refusal. Checked twice: as written, and again where the path *really*
//      leads once links are followed, because a link inside the root is a door
//      out of it.
//   2. Only a `.json` path is taken, and never under a dot-folder or
//      `node_modules`: what `list_graphs` would not show, nothing else touches.
//      A project is named by its `flow.json`, and its nodes' files -- code.js,
//      prompt.md, history.md -- are read and written with it, inside the root.
//   3. A file that exists is overwritten only if it is already a graph. That is
//      what stops `save_graph` from being "write any JSON file" -- it cannot
//      replace `package.json`, because `package.json` has no `nodes`.
//   4. `ai-settings.json` is never opened by a tool, under any name that reaches
//      it. It holds the keys.
//   5. Nothing returned contains an environment variable, a key or settings
//      content. A provider's error message passes through, because it is how a
//      person finds out their model name is wrong; whatever in it matches a
//      configured secret is blanked first, and so is every other result.
//   6. What comes in is bounded (a description, a graph, one protocol line) and
//      so is what goes out: a run reports each value cut to a few hundred
//      characters, because a graph that reads a 5 MB file should not push 5 MB
//      through a model's context.
//
// What this does **not** confine is a graph that runs. `run_graph` executes code
// nodes, in the same sandbox every run uses (`nodeCode` in `core/node.ts`): no
// child processes, no native addons, no workers -- but files and the network
// stay open, because reading files is most of what a graph is for. So the root
// is a fence around what the *tools* touch, not around what a graph's own code
// touches. Point it at a project folder, not at a home directory.
