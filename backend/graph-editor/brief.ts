//                          type, where it comes from and what arrives there
//     {Output Definition}  output.js as it is, where it is written -- and after
//                          it, always, each output as wired: where it goes and
//                          what the node there wants
//     {Context}            the graph around the node, as the editor says it
//     {Example Files}      the files ✨ Input is given: each path, and the start of it
//     {Output Files}       the files ✨ Output is given, the same way
//
// A definition is sent as the file says it: it is what the node was written
// against, and a second wording of it would be a second thing to disagree.
// The wiring follows it whether or not there is one: a chart wants a figure
// after output.js was written too, and ✨ Output shown only the file it was
// replacing wrote a chart config the chart could not draw.
// What can be long is cut to a budget: the prompt has to leave a small local
// model room to answer.
