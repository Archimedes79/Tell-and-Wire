// Writing a node's files with a model.
//
// One entry point for every ✨: a node's input definition (input.js), its
// output definition (output.js), and its body -- code, an ai node's prompt, a
// data node's data. What is sent is a prompt -- the standard one for that ✨,
// or the node's own where someone changed it (`authoring/prompts.ts`) -- with
// its variables filled from what the node and the graph hold (`brief.ts`), and
// after it the frame this file owns: the file format and how to answer, which
// is what makes an answer usable and not what the person asks.
//
// A body can also be changed rather than written anew (`refine`): "Say what to
// change" sends the body there is, its output.js, what came of it and what to
// change, and gets the body back with the node's text restated to fit it -- and
// a new output.js where the change outgrows the one there is, which the body is
// then held to; ✨ Fix sends how it failed, and gets the repair a generation
// makes of its own first attempt (an output.js that cannot be read, corrected
// with it). Same prompt, same verify-and-repair: not a second generator.
//
// Code is not one call. It is written, run once on the example in the node's
// input.js, held to its output.js, and repaired once with the evidence when
// that fails -- because a wrong output key is the single most common way
// generated code "works" and still delivers nothing, and all of it becomes
// knowable the moment the code executes. The second pass is not "try again";
// it is "here is exactly what went wrong", which is why one extra round is
// usually enough and why there is no third. A definition whose example cannot
// be read is sent back once the same way.
//
// Every call a generation makes is recorded and handed back: the editor shows
// what was sent, and keeps it in the node's history.md.
